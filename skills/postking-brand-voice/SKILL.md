# Brand Voice & Quality

Keep generated and rewritten content on-brand and readable — list saved voice profiles, apply one to a generation or rewrite, and run a de-slop pass that strips LLM clichés and filler before it ships.

**Voice-profile creation is web-only.** Building a new voice profile (from a writing sample, imported social posts, or a deep voice for a key author) happens in the PostKing dashboard's voice-profiles page — there is no MCP tool to create, extract, or import a voice. This skill covers what comes after: listing an existing profile and applying it.

## When to Use

Use this skill when a user wants existing content rewritten in a specific saved brand voice, wants a `voiceId` to pass into another skill's generation call, or wants a de-slop pass to strip LLM clichés and filler before it ships.

## When NOT to Use

Not for creating a new voice profile — that's web-only, done in the PostKing dashboard. Not for generating original content from scratch — that's `postking-social`/`postking`, `postking-seo`, `postking-storylines`, or `postking-reddit`, each of which accepts a `voiceId` from this skill as a parameter. Not for presenting AI-generated content as human-written where a platform, client, publisher, or law expects disclosure.

## Minimal tool subset

This skill needs only these 5 tools out of PostKing's 200+:

- `list_voices` — list saved voice profiles with their IDs.
- `rewrite_with_voice` — rewrite arbitrary text in a specific saved voice.
- `rewrite_text` — general rewrite, optionally applying a voice profile.
- `humanize_text` — de-slop pass: replaces stock LLM phrasing (filler, hedges, canned transitions) with plainer, more specific prose.
- `check_ai_content` — diagnostic: flags passages that read as generic or templated, so a human can revise them.

## Prerequisites

1. Authenticated with credits — see the `postking-getting-started` skill.
2. A brand already onboarded — see the `postking-getting-started` skill.

Voices get applied downstream in the `postking` skill (posts, blogs, landing pages, repurposing), the `postking-seo` skill (article writing), and the `postking-storylines` skill (campaign drafts).

## Procedure

> "Rewrite this in our brand voice and cut the AI clichés."

1. **Build a voice (dashboard only, one-time).** If no voice profile exists yet, tell the user to build one in the PostKing dashboard's voice-profiles page (from a writing sample, imported social posts, or a deep author voice) — there is no MCP tool for this step.
2. **List voices.** `list_voices({})` — get the `profileId` for the voice to use.
3. **Apply at generation time (preferred).** Pass that voice id as the `voice`/`voiceProfileId` param directly on `generate_post`, `generate_blog_post`, `generate_landing_page`, `repurpose_content`, or `reddit_rewrite` — no separate rewrite pass needed. These tools live in the `postking`, `postking-seo`, `postking-storylines`, and `postking-reddit` skills.
4. **Apply to existing text.** `rewrite_with_voice({ profileId, text, platform })` — or `rewrite_text({ text, voice: profileId, platform })` for a lighter-touch pass.
5. **De-slop.** `humanize_text({ text, platform })` — replaces stock LLM phrasing and clichés with plainer, more specific prose. Run this after voice rewriting, right before the text ships.
6. **Spot-check (optional).** `check_ai_content({ text })` — flags passages that still read as generic or templated. Treat it as a diagnostic pointing at weak writing for a human to revise, not a number to optimise: do not loop `humanize_text` against the score.

## CLI fast path

`pking voice list` lists saved voices (equivalent to `list_voices`). Beyond that, the MCP path above is primary — do not assume additional `pking` flags exist for rewrite/humanize without checking `pking --help` first.

## Expected Output

Content rewritten in a chosen brand voice, with stock LLM phrasing and filler replaced by plainer, more specific prose.

## Disclosure

These tools improve writing quality. They do not change the fact that the content was AI-generated, and must not be used to conceal AI authorship where a platform, client, publisher, or law requires it to be disclosed.

## Pitfalls

- `list_voices` returns empty — no voice profile exists yet; build one in the PostKing dashboard (creation is web-only, not available via MCP).
- `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` — surface the `checkoutUrl` from the error envelope and stop, or hand off to the `postking-getting-started` skill's billing section (`billing_list_packs` → `billing_topup`).
- `RATE_LIMITED` — back off using the `retryAfter` value from the error envelope before retrying.
- `UNAUTHORIZED` — re-run the login flow described in the `postking-getting-started` skill.

## Verification

- `list_voices({})` should return successfully; a non-empty result confirms at least one profile exists to reference.
- After `humanize_text`, the result should come back successfully and read as plainer and more specific than the original — judge the copy itself, not a detector score.
